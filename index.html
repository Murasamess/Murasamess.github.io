  <h1> About Us </h1>
  <p> ESG reading for HKUST
  </p>

  <p>  we've focus on papers/articles on ESG. Our meetings and discussions are casual, and there is no obligation or expectation to attend. While some background in computer science will help contextualize the papers, there is no required background and we strongly encourage younger/less experienced undergraduates to come.
  </p>

  <p> All are welcome to join </p>
